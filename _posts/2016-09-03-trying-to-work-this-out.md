# trying to work this out

First Post, innit.

Not sure how this is going to work.

This update is built solely from 2015 tunes, mostly from August / September, and so predominantly tracks I've been caning whilst traveling. It's probably as close as you'll get to I'd be playing out right now if I hadn't officially hung up my headphones a few years back.

It's an upfront house session, mainly influenced by Jane and Heath as we were staying with them in Melbourne when I sorted the tracklist.

It seems that even six months off work doesn't give me enough of a window to fill the gaping abyss left by mixes waiting to be sorted. Enough gap-filling, time for something contemporary. This update is built solely from 2015 tunes, mostly from August / September, and so predominantly tracks I've been caning whilst traveling. It's probably as close as you'll get to I'd be playing out right now if I hadn't officially hung up my headphones a few years back.

It's an upfront house session, mainly influenced by Jane and Heath as we were staying with them in Melbourne when I sorted the tracklist. I have fond memories being driven around while banging through their awesome tech and deep house playlists.

Seeing as I have a bit of spare time on my hands (it's raining here in Fiji), I've edited the feck out of this session. As a result it moves along pretty quickly. I don't usually edit this heavily - it can makes mixes feel a bit too much like a Ministry compilation - but on reflection I quite like the results when verses, or over-lengthy breakdowns, are cut. It keeps the vibe consistent and continuous. And given that my last mix was nearly three hours long (who's going to listen all the way through _that_?) this means I can squeeze nineteen tracks into a CD-friendly 80 minutes. I haven't edited like this since Minidisc days.

Stand-out tracks: Dusky's _Skin Deep_ is my tune of the summer. The Hayden James opener is from the start of the year but is an earworm I can't dislodge. It's great to see Full Intention back on form this year, ditto Roisin Murphy. There's the usual re-rubs of familiar classics in the mix and even a junglist breakbeak twist on Jamie XX's _Loud Places_ before we end with my favourite remix of _Holding On, _the first outing from Disclosure's second album.

Enjoy!

I have never owned or used a Yashima cassette tape but it seemed fitting given we've been through japan recently buying records. It has UFO in its name. It's 'high energy' and 'ultra dynamic'. What more do you need?
